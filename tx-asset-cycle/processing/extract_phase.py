class RecordProcessor(processor.RecordProcessorBase):
    """AWS Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL) record processor for mining data.

    Processes streaming data from AWS Kinesis shards containing real-time
    mining asset telemetry. Implements the KCL RecordProcessorBase interface
    to handle shard initialization, record processing, checkpointing, and
    graceful shutdown.

    The processor follows the standard KCL lifecycle:
    1. initialize() - Called once when assigned to a shard
    2. process_records() - Called repeatedly with batches of records
    3. shutdown() - Called when losing shard lease or shard ends

    Key Features:
        - Robust database connection management with retry logic
        - Automatic checkpointing with configurable frequency
        - Sequence number tracking for exactly-once processing
        - Error handling and recovery for transient failures
        - Support for multiple transaction types via environment configuration

    Configuration:
        - TX_TYPE environment variable determines processing mode
        - Checkpoint frequency and retry parameters are configurable
        - Database connection retry logic with exponential backoff

    Processing Pipeline:
        Real-time data flows through transform â†’ load phases:
        1. Transform: Parse and validate incoming telemetry data
        2. Load: Persist processed data to PostgreSQL

    Attributes:
        _SLEEP_SECONDS (int): Delay between checkpoint retry attempts.
        _CHECKPOINT_RETRIES (int): Maximum checkpoint retry attempts.
        _CHECKPOINT_FREQ_SECONDS (int): Checkpoint frequency in seconds.
        _largest_seq (Tuple[int, int]): Highest processed sequence number
            and sub-sequence number for checkpointing.
        _last_checkpoint_time (float): Timestamp of last successful checkpoint.
        pgsql_dao (PgsqlActionDAO | None): PostgreSQL database connection.
        redis_dao (RedisSourceDAO | None): Redis cache connection.
        max_retries (int): Maximum database connection retry attempts.

    Example:
        >>> # KCL framework instantiates and manages the processor
        >>> processor = RecordProcessor()
        >>> # Framework calls initialize, process_records, shutdown automatically

    Environment Variables:
